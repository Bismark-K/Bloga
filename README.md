# Bloga

## Description
This project leverages the power of AssemblyAI and OpenAI to automatically generate high-quality blog articles from YouTube videos. By simply pasting a YouTube link, the system transcribes the video content using AssemblyAI, and then uses OpenAI's language model to craft a coherent and engaging blog article. This tool streamlines the content creation process, making it easy to transform video insights into written form.
